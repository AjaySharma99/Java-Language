Java is simple and familiar:
=============================
Java is simple because java simplifies the programmer’s job by avoiding certain features of c and C++. Java avoids
explicit memory management. Memory management in java is automatic. It is done by JVM. So there are no chances of
memory leakage There is no pointer in java. Java is familiar because it is modeled on the Cand C++ Language. Java uses
many features of C and C++, therefore java codes look like C++ codes. We can say java is a simplified version of C++.

Java is Portable:
========================
Portability allows the programmer to write the same code for different machines (operating systems). 
Java provides portability in two ways
Source code portability
Byte code portability
In Java, we can write the source code as well as the byte code in different OS and also get the output.
Whereas in the case of C and C++ there is only source code portability.

Java is architecturally neutral:
==================================
The behavior of java programs doesn’t change when we move from one system to another which means it will provide 
the same output in every machine because in java memory layout decisions are not made at compile time, it is made
at run time by JVM. But in the case of C and C++ programs, the behavior changes when we move the program from one
system to another.

Java is Secured:
=======================
Java is secured because of the two reasons
There is no pointer in java. A pointer in java is called a restricted pointer means there is no Pointer Arithmetic.
Java programs are executed in a secured environment called JVM. JVM will provide security to the java programs.

Java is Robust:
=======================
Robust means strong. Java is a strong Type Checking Language having strict Type Checking during both compilation 
time and execution time which allows us to develop both error-free applications and programs.

Java is Strongly-Typed:
=========================
The types of the used variables must be pre-defined and conversion to other objects is relatively strict.

Java is Distributed:
=========================
Java provides a set of APIs which allows users to develop distributed applications. It means java language
is used for developing distributed applications whose resources are shared by more than one client.
An application or program whose resources are shared by more than one client is called a distributed 
application. As java is used for developing such applications. So, java is a distributed programming language.

Java is Multithreaded:
=========================
A process is divided into several small parts known as threads or lightweight processes. Sending multiple
threads to the processor for processing is known as Multi-Threading. Multi-threading means handling multiple 
tasks simultaneously. For example, we can listen to music while scrolling a page and at the same time we can 
download an application from the internet on a computer. Java supports multithreaded programming.

Java is Compiled and Interpreted:
===================================
We know a programming language is either compiled or interpreted. But java combines both approaches. 
That’s why java is called a two-stage system.

First java compiler JAVAC translates source code into an intermediate code known as byte code. 
But codes are not machine instructions. So in the second stage, this byte code is interpreted by the java interpreter
(JVM) in java. As a result machine instructions will be generated which are directly executed by the machine. Hence
we are saying java is both interpreted and compiled language.

Java is Object-Oriented:
=============================
Except for the primitive data types, all elements in Java are objects. Object-oriented is not a programming 
language, it is a programming technique or concept, or principle which defines a set of rules and regulations 
for organizing the data and instructions. The concepts provided by oops are as follows

Encapsulation
Abstraction
Polymorphism
Inheritance
The programming language supports these four features known as an object-oriented programming language.
Java supports these four features so java is object-oriented.

Java is Platform Independent :
=================================
Many languages are compatible with only one platform. Java was specifically designed so that it would run on any 
computer, regardless if it was running Windows, Linux, Mac, Unix, or any of the other operating systems.

Automatic Memory Management :
==================================
Java manages memory allocation and de-allocation for creating new objects. The program does not have direct access
to memory. The so-called garbage collector automatically deletes objects to which no active pointer exists.

Java definition based on these features:
Java is just a simple, secure, robust, portable, platform-independent, architectural neutral, multithreaded,
object-oriented programming language with a strong type exception handling mechanism for developing distributed, 
dynamically extensible programs
