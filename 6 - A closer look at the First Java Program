Step 1 --->>>>    public class FirstProgram{  

This is the first line of our java program. Every java application must have at least one class definition that consists of a class keyword followed by the class name.
When I say the keyword, it means that it should not be changed, we should use it as it is. However, the class name can be anything.
I have made the class public by using the public access modifier, I will cover the access modifier in a separate post, all you need to know now is that a java file 
can have any number of classes but it can have only one public class and the file name should be same as the public class name.

Step 2 --->>>>   public static void main(String args[])

public: This makes the main method public which means that we can call the method from outside the class.
static: We do not need to create an object for static methods to run. They can run themselves.
void: It does not return anything.
main: It is the method name. This is the entry point method from which the JVM can run your program.
(String[] args): Used for command-line arguments that are passed as strings. 

Step 3 --->>>>  System.out.println(“Hello World”);

This method prints the contents inside the double quotes into the console and inserts a newline after.
