Creating First Java Program

public class FirstProgram
{
    Public static void main(String args[])
    {
        System.out.println(“Hello World”);
    }   //End of Main
 }      //End of class


Output:=====>>>>> Hello World
------------------------------------------------------------------
To Compile and Run the Above Program

Open the Text Editor like Notepad, then Copy and Paste the above code into the text editor.
Save the file as FirstProgram.java. You may be wondering why we have named the file as FirstProgram, the thing is that we should always name the file the same as the 
public class name. In our program, the public class name is FirstProgram, that’s why our file name should be saved as FirstProgram.java
Now we will 
        Compile the program.
           To compile the program, O
Open your Command Prompt and type javac FirstProgram.java, and press Enter.

Note: You may get this error when you try to compile the program: “javac” is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file.
This error occurs when the java path is not set in your system. In this case, you first need to set the Path before compiling your program.
Set Path in Windows:
Open cmd, copy the complete path where you have installed java in your system and write it in cmd.

Note: This path setting is temporary, when you close the cmd you will lose the path setting and you need it to set it again when you want to run the code.

= = = = = = = = = > > > > > > > >    set path=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_121\bin
After compilation the .java file gets translated into .class file(byte code). Now we can run the program. To run  program, type the following command and press enter:

java FirstProgram

Note: You don’t need to append .java while running the code.
